```

When you have finished all of the questions - open a pull request with your answers to the `Databases-Homework` repository.

## Task

1. Create a new database called `cyf_classes` (hint: use `createdb` in the terminal)
2. Create a new table `mentors`, for each mentor we want to save their name, how many years they lived in Glasgow, their address and their favourite programming language.
3. Insert 5 mentors in the `mentors` table (you can make up the data, it doesn't need to be accurate ;-)).
4. Create a new table `students`, for each student we want to save their name, address and if they have graduated from Code Your Future.
5. Insert 10 students in the `students` table.
6. Verify that the data you created for mentors and students are correctly stored in their respective tables (hint: use a `select` SQL statement).
7. Create a new `classes` table to record the following information:

   - A class has a leading mentor
   - A class has a topic (such as Javascript, NodeJS)
   - A class is taught at a specific date and at a specific location

8. Insert a few classes in the `classes` table
9. We now want to store who among the students attends a specific class. How would you store that? Come up with a solution and insert some data if you model this as a new table.
10. Answer the following questions using a `select` SQL statement:
    - Retrieve all the mentors who lived more than 5 years in Glasgow
    - Retrieve all the mentors whose favourite language is Javascript
    - Retrieve all the students who are CYF graduates
    - Retrieve all the classes taught before June this year
    - Retrieve all the students (retrieving student ids only is fine) who attended the Javascript class (or any other class that you have in the `classes` table).
